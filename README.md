# CECS-274
Programs written for my introduction to Java and OOP class.
One of the core teachings this class offers is teaching data structures
rather than a main focus of just teaching java.
Among many programs were these uploaded here which taught me well
how to build a linkedlist, stack, and a queue as well as a solitatire game.
